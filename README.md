## Process

To complete the final project, you will go through multiple development stages.

1. **Choose your website topic**. Your website topic and content should be legally presentable.

   The following topics are prohibited in the final project:

   - Illegal content
   - Sexual
   - Violent
   - Drug related

2. **Wireframing**. Wireframing is the technique that promotes communication, generate feedback and tests various options.

   Wireframing could be in any forms and shapes. You can use any medium to complete your wireframing, such as pen/pencil & paper, Sketch, Photoshop, Illustrator and Figma, etc.

3. **Design**. Design is a mockup of your final project. Mockup is where your project will begin to take shape. When wireframing is meant to quickly come up with a concept, mockup is where things take life.

   You will add colors and content to your mockup. In this stage, you may not have all the images, videos and text content ready. So you can reuse the same images in multiple places as placeholders. For text content, you may use Lorem Ipsum dummy text [https://www.lipsum.com/](https://www.lipsum.com/).
   
4. **Coding**. You will code your website (6 pages) in HTML5 and CSS3 (make use of JavaScript and JQuery) in Visual Studio Code, then test/run it on Google Chrome browser. In this stage, you should have all images, videos and text content needed for your website.

5. **Website deployment**. GitHub online account and GitHub Desktop will be utilized for your website deployment. Instructions on creating a GitHub account, installing GitHub Desktop and other GitHub related tasks will be provided throughout the course.

## Progress Peer Review

Peer reviews on wireframes, design mockups and coding each page are built in the lecture time. Participation is required.

## Written Summary

You are required to write a summary for your final project. Details will be provided in the course.

## Final Project Presentation & Peer Review

Final project presentation and peer review will be conducted in Week 10 (Lecture 10). Participation is required. Details will be provided in the course.

## Equipment, Tools and Resources Required to Complete the Final Project
