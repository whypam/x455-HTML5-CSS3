## Process

To complete the final project, you will go through multiple development stages.

1. Choose your website topic. Your website topic and content should be legally presentable.  
    The topic content should be none of the followings:
   • Illegal content
   • Sexual
   • Violent
   • Drug related
   • Offensive / Abusive
   • Discrimination

   Examples of topics:
   • Portfolio
   • Hobby
   • Travelling
   • Catering
   • Baking and cooking
   • Enhancement of existing website
   • Introduction of certain cultures
   • Music band
   • Knowledge sharing
   • Etc.

2. Wireframing. Wireframing is the technique that promotes communication, generate feedback and tests various options.

   Wireframing could be in any forms and shapes. You can use any medium to complete your wireframing, such as pen/pencil & paper, Sketch, Photoshop, Illustrator and Figma, etc.

3. Design. Design is a mockup of your final project. Mockup is where your project will begin to take shape. When wireframing is meant to quickly come up with a concept, mockup is where things take life.

   You will add colors and content to your mockup. In this stage, you may not have all the images, videos and text content ready. So you can reuse the same images in multiple places as placeholders. For text content, you may use Lorem Ipsum dummy text [https://www.lipsum.com/](https://www.lipsum.com/).

4. Prototyping. Make use of design software (e.g., Figma, Adobe XDesign, InVision) to build simulation of your website. That means the prototype will behave the same or similar to your actual website.

   You can choose any software to build the prototype, just make sure the software has an option to create a public share link, because you will need to submit the public share link to Canvas.

5. Coding. You will code your website (6 pages) in HTML5 and CSS3 (make use of JavaScript and JQuery) in Visual Studio Code, then test/run it on Google Chrome browser. In this stage, you should have all images, videos and text content needed for your website.

6. Website deployment. GitHub online account and GitHub Desktop will be utilized for your website deployment. Instructions on creating a GitHub account, installing GitHub Desktop and other GitHub related tasks will be provided throughout the course.

## Peer Review

Peer reviews on prototyping and coding each page are built in the lecture time. Participation is required.

## Written Summary

You are required to write a summary for your final project. Details will be provided in the course.

## Presentation & Peer Review

Final project presentation and peer review will be conducted in Week 10 (Lecture 10). Participation is required. Details will be provided in the course.

## Final Project Grading

20% of the course grading

| Home Page | 2nd Page | 3rd Page | 4th Page | 5th Page | 6th Page | Summary, Presentation & Review |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
