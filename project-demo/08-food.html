            Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other
            animals as food. The original meaning is still commonly used and is
            applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter,
            including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. An
            alternate definition of the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily,
            often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods
            derived from some plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal
            grains, but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes,
            flowers such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vegetables play an important role in human nutrition. Most are low
            in fat and calories but are bulky and filling. They supply dietary
            fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and
            trace elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins
            A, C, and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is
            found to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke,
            cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments. Research has
            shown that, compared with individuals who eat less than three
            servings of fruits and vegetables each day, those that eat more than
            five servings have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of
            developing coronary heart disease or stroke. The nutritional content
            of vegetables varies considerably; some contain useful amounts of
            protein though generally they contain little fat, and varying
            proportions of vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin K, and vitamin
            B6; provitamins; dietary minerals; and carbohydrates.

            Plant scientists have classified fruits into three main groups:
            simple fruits, aggregate fruits, and multiple (or composite) fruits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Simple fleshy fruits from apples to berries to watermelon; simple
            dry fruits including beans and rice, coconuts and carrots; aggregate
            fruits including strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, pawpaw;
            multiple fruits such as pineapple, fig, mulberries; (see above re
            all)â€” are commercially valuable as human food. They are eaten both
            fresh and as jams, marmalade and other fruit preserves. They are
            used extensively in manufactured and processed foods (cakes,
            cookies, baked goods, flavorings, ice cream, yogurt, canned
            vegetables, frozen vegetables and meals) and beverages such as fruit
            juices and alcoholic beverages (brandy, fruit beer, wine). Spices
            like vanilla, black pepper, paprika, and allspice are derived from
            berries. Olive fruit is pressed for olive oil and similar processing
            is applied to other oil bearing fruits/vegetables.
          </p>
          <p>
            Various culinary fruits provide significant amounts of fiber and
            water and present significant resistance to chewing; many are
            generally high in vitamin C. An overview of numerous studies show
            that fruits (e.g., whole apples or whole oranges) are very
            satisfying (filling) in the acts of simply eating and chewing them.
            The fiber consumed in eating fruit promote satiety and help to
            control weight gain and to provide cholesterol-lowering effects.
            Regular consumption of fruit is generally associated with reduced
            risks of several diseases and functional declines associated with
            aging. A current review for meta-analyses concludes that even
            current assessments might significantly underestimate the protective
            associations of regularly eating fruits and vegetables.
