    <p class="demo1">PLANT SCIENTISTS</p> have classified fruits into three main groups: simple
    fruits, aggregate fruits, and multiple (or composite) fruits.

    Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other
    animals as food. The <p class="demo3">ORIGINAL MEANING</p> is still commonly used and is
    applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter,
    including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds.

    An <p class="demo4">ALTERNATIVE DEFINITION</p> of the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily,
    often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived
    from some plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal grains,
    but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowers
    such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses.
