          Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other
          animals as food. The original meaning is still commonly used and is
          applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter,
          including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. An
          alternate definition of the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily,
          often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived
          from some plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal grains,
          but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowers
          such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses.
        </p>

          Vegetables play an important role in human nutrition. Most are low in
          fat and calories but are bulky and filling. They supply dietary fiber
          and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace
          elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C,
          and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found to be
          a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke, cardiovascular
          disease, and other chronic ailments. Research has shown that, compared
          with individuals who eat less than three servings of fruits and
          vegetables each day, those that eat more than five servings have an
          approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing coronary heart
          disease or stroke. The nutritional content of vegetables varies
          considerably; some contain useful amounts of protein though generally
          they contain little fat, and varying proportions of vitamins such as
          vitamin A, vitamin K, and vitamin B6; provitamins; dietary minerals;
          and carbohydrates.

          Plant scientists have classified fruits into three main groups: simple
          fruits, aggregate fruits, and multiple (or composite) fruits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simple fleshy fruits from apples to berries to watermelon; simple dry
          fruits including beans and rice, coconuts and carrots; aggregate
          fruits including strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, pawpaw;
          multiple fruits such as pineapple, fig, mulberries; (see above re
          all)— are commercially valuable as human food. They are eaten both
          fresh and as jams, marmalade and other fruit preserves. They are used
          extensively in manufactured and processed foods (cakes, cookies, baked
          goods, flavorings, ice cream, yogurt, canned vegetables, frozen
          vegetables and meals) and beverages such as fruit juices and alcoholic
          beverages (brandy, fruit beer, wine). Spices like vanilla, black
          pepper, paprika, and allspice are derived from berries. Olive fruit is
          pressed for olive oil and similar processing is applied to other oil
          bearing fruits/vegetables.

          Various culinary fruits provide significant amounts of fiber and water
          and present significant resistance to chewing; many are generally high
          in vitamin C. An overview of numerous studies show that fruits (e.g.,
          whole apples or whole oranges) are very satisfying (filling) in the
          acts of simply eating and chewing them. The fiber consumed in eating
          fruit promote satiety and help to control weight gain and to provide
          cholesterol-lowering effects. Regular consumption of fruit is
          generally associated with reduced risks of several diseases and
          functional declines associated with aging. A current review for
          meta-analyses concludes that even current assessments might
          significantly underestimate the protective associations of regularly
          eating fruits and vegetables.

          A grain is a small, hard, dry seed - with or without an attached hull
          or fruit layer - harvested for human or animal consumption. After
          being harvested, dry grains are more durable than other staple foods,
          such as starchy fruits (plantains, breadfruit, etc.) and tubers (sweet
          potatoes, cassava, and more). This durability has made grains well
          suited to industrial agriculture, since they can be mechanically
          harvested, transported by rail or ship, stored for long periods in
          silos, and milled for flour or pressed for oil. Thus, major global
          commodity markets exist for maize, rice, soybeans, wheat and other
          grains but not for tubers, vegetables, or other crops.

          Legumes are a significant source of protein, dietary fiber,
          carbohydrates and dietary minerals; for example, a 100 gram serving of
          cooked chickpeas contains 18 percent of the Daily Value (DV) for
          protein, 30 percent DV for dietary fiber, 43 percent DV for folate and
          52 percent DV for manganese. Legumes are also an excellent source of
          resistant starch which is broken down by bacteria in the large
          intestine to produce short-chain fatty acids (such as butyrate) used
          by intestinal cells for food energy.

          Nuts contain the diverse nutrients that are needed for the growth of a
          new plant. Composition varies, but they tend to have a low water and
          carbohydrate content, with high levels of fats, protein, dietary
          minerals, and vitamins. The digestibility of the protein at about 90%
          is slightly lower than that of meat and fish, but can be improved by
          thorough chewing. The fats are largely unsaturated and nuts are a
          source of essential omega-3 fatty acids. As part of a healthy human
          diet, long-term consumption of diverse nutrients in nuts may
          contribute to a lower risk of cardiovascular diseases, reduced levels
          of blood cholesterol, and lower all-cause mortality. For vegetarians
          and vegans, nuts provide many of the essential nutrients which may be
          in short supply in other plant foods.
        </p>

          Nuts are the source of energy and nutrients for the new plant. They
          contain a relatively large quantity of calories, essential unsaturated
          and monounsaturated fats including linoleic acid and linolenic acid,
          vitamins, and essential amino acids. Many nuts are good sources of
          vitamin E, vitamin B2, folate, fiber, and essential minerals, such as
          magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, copper, and selenium.

          An edible seed is a seed that is suitable for human or animal
          consumption. Of the six major plant parts, seeds are the dominant
          source of human calories and protein. A wide variety of plant species
          provide edible seeds; most are angiosperms, while a few are
          gymnosperms. As a global food source, the most important edible seeds
          by weight are cereals, followed by legumes, nuts, then spices.
