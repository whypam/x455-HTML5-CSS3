      Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other
      animals as food. The original meaning is still commonly used and is
      applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter,
      including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. An
      alternate definition of the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily, often by
      culinary and cultural tradition. <br />It may exclude foods derived from
      some plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal grains, but include
      savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowers such as broccoli,
      and seeds such as pulses.
